# Tilt-Avoid-Game
This project showcases my skills in embedded systems development and game programming using the MSP432 microcontroller. The Tilt-Avoid Game is a tilt-based game where players navigate through obstacles by tilting the device. It demonstrates my proficiency in C, FreeRTOS, and low-level hardware interactions.
## Features
- Intuitive tilt controls for navigating the player character.
- Dynamic obstacle generation to challenge the player's skills
- Real-time feedback through the LCD screen and buzzer.
- Integration of peripherals such as accelerometer, light sensor, and buttons.
- Ongoing development to add new features and improve gameplay.

## Installation and Usage
As this project is designed for the MSP432 microcontroller, direct installation on external systems may not be possible. However, a video demonstration of the game's functionality is available upon request.

## Project Status
This project is still actively being developed. I am continuously enhancing the gameplay, optimizing performance, and adding new features to create a more immersive gaming experience.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Embedded systems development
- C programming
- Real-time operating systems (FreeRTOS)
- Low-level hardware interactions (accelerometer, LCD, buzzer)
- Problem-solving and debugging

Feel free to reach out for more information or to discuss this project in more detail.

**Note**: The Tilt-Avoid Game is best experienced on an MSP432 microcontroller with the required peripherals and sensors.
